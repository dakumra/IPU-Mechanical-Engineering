# MAIT-Mechanical Engineering
 Study materials and relative content for the mechanical students of MAIT

#### Hi, I am Daksh and right now a Third year mechanical student (ME) in MAIT. I am creating this repository for all ME/MAE students so there's no lack of information and atleast the "Kaha se karna hai" work is minimised 

If you have any concerns or suggestions feel free to connect with me on my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dakshmathur2604/).

I hope that this repository is maintained and modified according to the needs of the students so please share this with your classmates and improve it for easier access to Information


Drop any study material here and i'll arrange it and upload it to the mega cloud [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/request/hoZieb4YAXOxLqWbITAO)
