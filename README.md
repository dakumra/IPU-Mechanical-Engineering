 Study materials and relative content for the mechanical students of MAIT

#### Hi, I am Daksh and right now a Third year mechanical student (ME) in MAIT. I am creating this repository for all my juniors so they don't have to worry about relative information and aren't left behind due to lack of information. (In the branch section) is a Google drive folder that I download PDFs to and i hope its useful to you guys. 

If you have any concerns or suggestions feel free to connect with me on my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dakshmathur2604/).

I hope that this repository is maintained and modified according to the needs of the students so please share this with your classmates and improve it for easier access to Information
